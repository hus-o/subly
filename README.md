## How to use
- This project is hosted on: 
- If you wish to clone it, you can run it by using the command `npm start`

## Project Libraries
- I have used React with Typescript as required. This is my first time using Typescript so I took a day to read up on it as I only had passing knowledge of its use. 
- I opted to use Tailwinds for CSS and Axios as my data fetching library.
- For testing I will use jest with enzyme. I aim to complete the MVP before doing this.

## Project Architecture
- I decide to have separate components for each media status this way it is cleaner to read and use, updates to the design are also much easier to make.
- I have added comments in different sections explaining either what they do or my choices.
